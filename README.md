# Belmont Forum e-Infrastructures & Data Management Toolkit  

This repository contains resources (links to training, policies, best practices, and other information) that enable Belmont Forum researchers to meet the Data Management expectations described in the Data and Digital Objects Management Plan found here: http://www.bfe-inf.org/resource/belmont-forum-data-and-digital-objects-management-plan, as well as a step-by-step guide to completing the DDOMP at the stages of pre-proposal, full proposal, and awarded projects. See the main website for Belmont Forum e-Infrastructures and Data Management here: http://www.bfe-inf.org/, and visit the Belmont Forum's main website here: http://www.belmontforum.org/.
