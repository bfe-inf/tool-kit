# Belmont Forum e-Infrastructures & Data Management Toolkit  

This repository contains resources (links to training, policies, best practices, and other information) that enable Belmont Forum researchers to meet the Data Management expectations described in the <a href="http://www.bfe-inf.org/sites/default/files/doc-repository/CRA_Data_Digital_Outputs_Management_Annex_20180501.pdf">Data and Digital Objects Management Plan</a>, as well as a step-by-step guide to completing the DDOMP at the stages of pre-proposal, full proposal, and awarded projects. See the main website for Belmont Forum e-Infrastructures and Data Management here: http://www.bfe-inf.org/, and visit the Belmont Forum's main website here: http://www.belmontforum.org/. The toolkit also serves as a general guide to data management for researchers and data professionals outside of Belmont Forum organizations.
