					<h2>Data and Digital Outputs Management Approach</h2>	
					<p>In the Data and Digital Outputs Management section of the BFGO proposal template, researchers should address the following questions and elaborate on the information provided at the Pre-Proposal Stage, where appropriate. Included here are resources for Belmont Forum researchers to address each question correctly and comprehensively:</p><br/>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>What types of datasets and other digital outputs of long-term value do you expect that the project will produce or reuse?</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Considering which data and digital outputs you would like to preserve during and after your research project will help your research team understand how to organize your data management and anticipate certain costs. For best practices on identifying data with long-term value, please visit the following resources:</li> 
									<ul style="list-style-type:square">
										<li><a href="https://www.dataone.org/best-practices/decide-what-data-preserve" target="_blank">DataONE: Decide what data to preserve</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://www.dataone.org/best-practices/identify-data-long-term-value" target="_blank">DataONE: Identify data with long-term value</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://www.dataone.org/best-practices/store-data-appropriate-precision" target="_blank">DataONE: Store data with appropriate precision</a></li>
									</ul>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>How do you intend to ensure that the data and digital outputs from your project conform to the <a href="http://www.belmontforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Belmont-Forum-Data-Policy-and-Principles.pdf" target="_blank">Belmont Forum Open Data Policy and Principles</a> and the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618" target="_blank">FAIR principles</a>?</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Which member(s) of your team will be responsible for developing, implementing, overseeing, and updating the Data and Digital Outputs Management Plan?</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>While all members of your research team should understand and support data management best practices within your project, it is important to delegate the development, implementation, oversight, and maintenance of the DDOMP to collaborators on your team who possess the necessary skillsets and training. For more resources on what to consider as you designate a data manager, please visit the following links:</li>
									<ul style="list-style-type:square">
										<li><a href="https://www.dataone.org/best-practices/define-roles-and-assign-responsibilities-data-management" target="_blank">DataONE: Define roles and assign responsibilities for data management</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/plan/roles-and-responsibilities" target="_blank">UK Data Service: Roles and Responsibilities of data management teams and collaborators</a></li>
									</ul>	
								<li>Does your research team currently lack experience in data management training and best practices? Consider getting up to speed using our <a href="https://bfe-inf.github.io/tool-kit/" target="_blank">e-Infrastructures & Data Management Tool Kit</a>, which contains location- and organization-specific resources on data management training, certifications, best practices, and more. Prior to submitting a project for funding through a Belmont Forum partner organization, members of your research team should have a general understanding of data management in order to properly complete this portion of the DDOMP.</li>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>How do you intend to manage the data and digital outputs during the project to ensure their long-term value is protected?</strong></li>
						<li><strong>How and by whom will the data and other digital outputs be managed after the project ends to ensure their long-term accessibility?</strong></li>
						<li><strong>What restrictions, if any, do you anticipate could be placed on how the data and digital outputs can be accessed, mined or reused?</strong></li>
							<ul> 
								<li>Your research team will want to include information on how your data and digital outputs will be licensed, and how the licensing outlines terms of access, mining, and reuse. For more information on best practices in licensing, please see the "Licensing" section of the BFE-INF Tool Kit <a href="https://bfe-inf.github.io/tool-kit/bp&s-licensing.html" target="_blank">here.</a></li>
							</ul>		
						<li><strong>How will you ensure that any data security, privacy, and intellectual property restrictions associated with datasets and digital outputs will be honored and preserved in derivative products?</strong></li>
						<li><strong>What supporting documentation and other information (e.g., metadata) do you plan to make publicly accessible to support the longer-term reuse of the data and digital outputs?</strong></li>
							<ul> 
								<li>Providing supporting metadata with your data is imperative in supporting open data and collaborative research. For resources on creating appropriate metadata for your project, please see the "Metadata" section of the BFE-INF Tool Kit <a href="https://bfe-inf.github.io/tool-kit/bp&s-metadata.html" target="_blank">here.</a></li>
								<li>Many research projects will have supporting documentation (not including metadata) which give other researchers insights into how to reuse the data and digital outputs for continuing research. Consider using a version-control document repository, such as <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>, to store your project's supporting documentation in an accessible format.</li>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>How have you accounted for the costs required to manage the data and digital outputs to ensure long-term accessibility?</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Once your team has an idea of what data you want to store, and who will primarily be in charge of your data management, you will need to estimate potential costs of this storage. The resources below will help your team determine what these costs may be for inclusion in your DDOMP:</li>
