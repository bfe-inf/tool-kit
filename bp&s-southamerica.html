	     					<li> <strong>Organization:</strong> Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research - IAI (Uruguay) <br/>
		   				<strong>Policies:</strong> The IAI requires a continuing commitment from Grantees and PIs to the establishment, maintenance, validation, description, accessibility, and distribution of high-quality data that results from research supported by IAI grants. Any data, information, and results generated by IAI-funded programs and projects should be fully described and submitted to the IAI Directorate for inclusion in the IAI Open Data Catalog. Data archives must include easily accessible information about the data holdings, including quality assessments, supporting ancillary information, and guidance for locating and obtaining the data. International standards should be used to the greatest extent possible for media and for processing and exchange of data sets.

      					</ul>

	     					<li> <strong>Organization:</strong> International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT (Colombia) <br/>
		   				<strong>Policies:</strong> CIAT adheres to the CGIAR (Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research) Open Access and Data Management policy, which mandates for the widest possible distribution of all CIAT information products, while allowing for restrictions where legally applicable. CIAT also provides a Data Management Support Pack (linked below), which provides resources to help researchers produce high quality, reusable and open data from research activities. These resources, in the form of documents, templates, and videos, are organized by the role of the individual (PI, Researcher, or Data Manager), the stage of the research project, and by category, such as managing data, metadata, archiving & sharing, etc.

	     					<li> <strong>Organization:</strong> Ministry of Science, Technology, and Productive Innovation (Argentina) <br/>
		   				<strong>Policies:</strong> Although the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Productive Innovation does not have a formal data management policy, the organization promotes open access and sharing of scientific and technological production generated in the country, and partners with the National System of Digital Repositories to allow institutions to request funding in order to create/strengthen their digital repositories for open data.

	     					<li> <strong>Organization:</strong> Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP (Brazil) <br/>
		   				<strong>Policies:</strong> In the FAPESP 2012 Code of Good Scientific Practice, it is stated that original research data should be securely stored for a substantial period after the study's results are published; the length of this period may vary according to the study's area and characteristics, but should be a minimum of five years. Researchers and their research institutions share the responsibility for data storage. After the research is published, data and other research records must be made available to other researchers who wish to verify the study's correctness or replicate the study, and data accessibility may only be limited for ethical or legal reasons.
