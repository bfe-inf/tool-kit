	     					<li> <strong>Organization:</strong> Japan Science and Technology Agency - JST <br/>
		   				<strong>Policies:</strong> JST launched a new policy for open science and data management in April 2017. Based on this policy, JST adopts a general principle of Open Access to all research achievements funded by JST. JST also requires all research projects conducted through JST's programs to submit a Data Implementation Plan (DMP) before projects start. It is expected that the DMPs include a policy for data administration and preservation, secondary use and privacy policy with a recommendationof open access for evidential data in research. Researchers can use funding from JST to implement their DMPs in projects, but there is no statement in JST's policy regarding additional budget support for this purpose.

	     					<li> <strong>Organization:</strong> Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology - MEXT (Japan)  <br/>
		   				<strong>Policies:</strong> MEXT does not have a written policy on data sharing and does not outline a data management plan.</li>

	     					<li> <strong>Organization:</strong> Ministry of Science and Technology - MoST (Chinese Taipei)  <br/>
		   				<strong>Policies:</strong> For any MoST-funded project, the PI must sign a consent form before the implementation of the project. The consent form contains an item related to data deposition requirement for projects involving survey data collection. Within three months after the project is completed, for the projects based on survey method (e.g., face-to-face survey, telephone survey, and mail survey), the PI should provide an authorization form and deposit the data (including survey data, codebook, and other metadata files) to the Survey Research Data Archive (SRDA), Center for Humanities and Social Sciences, Academia, Sinica. However, in the authorization form, the PI can choose whether they agree to disseminate the data through SRDA, and how soon the data shall be disseminated after the project is finished (e.g., immediately, one year, two years, or some other years specified by the PI). The SRDA is a data archive for survey data. Its mission is to curate, disseminate, preserve, and promote usage of survey data in Taiwan.

	     					<li> <strong>Organization:</strong> National Development Council - NDC (Taiwan) <br/>
		   				<strong>Policies:</strong> Open data is an imperative for the government of Taiwan, and all research conducted through the government should meet three criteria: open license, open access, and open format. Open license refers to data that can be used, re-distributed, modified, divided, and edited, non-discriminatorily treated and delivered freely, as long as it is done with clear citation, original integrity, and the data are free from technical restrictions and mutual infringement. Open access designates that works shall be provided, ideally, free of charge to researchers. Open format data should be machine readable, in a publicly revealed format specification, and without charges or other restrictions on its uses. The NDC outlines several resources for understanding the importance of governmental open data in Taiwan in different research contexts.

	     					<li> <strong>Organization:</strong> Qatar National Research Fund - QNRF <br/>
		   				<strong>Policies:</strong> The fund Management Agreement that every awardee institution has to sign before the release of funds grants QNRF access to publications and scientific data arising from non-proprietary publicly releasable research (not necessarily digitally formatted) within the funded research, but there is not currently a policy that applies to other types of data sharing. QNRF does not currently have a requirement for data management plans, but are in the process of developing one release for later in 2017. Grant funds can be used for data management costs such as archiving. </li>
